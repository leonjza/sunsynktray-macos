A small, SwiftUI tray icon application to monitor SunSynk plants' state of charge, for macOS.

## other

If you are looking for a Windows alternative, check out [sunsynktray-win](https://github.com/leonjza/sunsynktray-win).

## installation

Check out the latest release Assets for `SunSynkTray.dmg`. Download, open, and drag the app to the Applications folder.

The app will probably have gatekeeper complain about it because its not signed (free Apple Developer account life!). To get it to run you need to allow the app in Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Scroll down and hit "Allow". Then open it again.
